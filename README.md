## 📁 Featured Projects

Here are a few projects I’m proud of:

- 🛰️ **[Senegal-LC-DL](https://github.com/nasa-nccs-hpda/senegal-lcluc-tensorflow)**  
  A deep learning-based framework for very-high-resolution land cover mapping using WorldView-2,-3 imagery.

- 🌾 **[Cropland-DPC](https://github.com/trile83/RQUNet-DPC)**  
  A deep learning-based pipeline for medium-resolution cropland mapping using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 imagery.

- 🛰️ **[Unsupervised-PlanetScope-LULC](https://github.com/trile83/PlanetScope-TimeSeries)**  
  An unsupervised framework using VBGMM for land cover classification without ground-truth labels using high-resolution crop and land use mapping using PlanetScope imagery.

- 🤖 **[RQUNet-VAE-Image-Denoise](https://github.com/trile83/RQUNetVAE)**  
  Research and prototypes using a DL framework to remove noise from satellite imagery.

- 🧬 **[PhyloView-COVID19](https://github.com/trile83/PhyloView)**  
  A visualization tool and dashboard for tracking the spread and movement of COVID-19 phylogenetic data from the onset.
